    "I have been working on this project since April 2021, after finishing PhD. I was initially hired as a data visualization specialist, but ended up doing a fair amount of data analysis and machine learning along the way. My main task has been to build a web application as a visualisation and analysis tool that allows users to explore the mouse brain in the lipid metabolic dimension. \n",

    "Lipids are fundamental constituents of all living beings: they participate in energy metabolism, account for the assembly of biological membranes, and act as signaling molecules. Brain cells produce thousands of different lipids, each with a distinct role in these biological processes. With the development of lipidomics, it is possible to study the lipid compositional complexity of different brain parts. Nonetheless, a systematic and fine-grained characterization of lipid metabolism in the different brain regions is not available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI), we have recently collected a large dataset of the spatial distribution (at the micrometric scale) of hundreds of lipids across the entire adult mouse brain. In this project, we develop tools that make use of the latest advances in computer science, statistical learning and neural networks to extract, normalize, integrate and analyze lipid distribution images of the brain from our data. These computational procedures will be instrumental for assembling the lipid metabolic atlas of the mouse brain, a resource with a tremendous impact on neurochemical research and the understanding of brain metabolism in health and disease. \n"

It is thought as a graphical user interface to assist the inspection and the analysis of a large mass-spectrometry dataset of lipids distribution at micrometric resolution across the entire mouse brain.\n",

    "All of the brain slices aquired have prealably been registered to the [Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v3.0](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420304025) (CCFv3), allowing for a hierarchically structured annotation of our data. This registration can be used to display lipid signal between two m/z boundaries in a given slice (*lipid selection* page, in the app) and perform analyses comparing neuroanatomical regions, e.g. averaging and comparing lipid abundance in each region and make an enrichment analysis (*region analysis* page, in the app). It is also used to combine the 2D slice acquisitions into a browsable 3d model of lipid expression (*three dimensional analysis* page, in the app).\n",

    "The multidimensional atlas of the mouse brain lipidome that you can explore through LBAE has been entirely acquired from MALDI Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) experiments. We have collected about 6 millions mass spectra, corresponding to 18’000 lipid images of 64 serial sections of two individual adult mouse brains (8 weeks old males BL6). Each pixel captures a region of $5μm$, with a spatial resolution of $25μm$ along a given slice and about $200μm$ across slices. The spectral resolution is of the order of $10^{-5} m/z$."
